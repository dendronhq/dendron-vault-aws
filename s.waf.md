# WAF

### WAF Basics

-	ðŸ“’ [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/) âˆ™ [Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/waf/) âˆ™ [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/faq/) âˆ™ [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing)
- WAF (Web Application Firewall) is used in conjunction with the CloudFront and ALB services to inspect and block/allow web requests based on user-configurable conditions.
- HTTPS and HTTP requests are supported with this service.
- WAF's strength is in detecting malicious activity based on pattern-matching inputs for attacks such as SQL injections, XSS, etc.
- WAF supports inspection of requests [received through both IPv6 and IPv4](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/10/ipv6-support-for-cloudfront-waf-and-s3-transfer-acceleration/).

### WAF Tips

- Getting a WAF API call history can be done through CloudTrail. This is enabled through the CloudTrail console.
- It's also possible to get [full
  logs of all the web requests inspected](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/08/aws-waf-launches-new-comprehensive-logging-functionality/)
