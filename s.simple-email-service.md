# Simple Email Service

### SES Basics

-	📒 [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) ∙ [Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ses/) ∙ [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/faqs/) ∙ [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/pricing/)
-	**SES** (or Simple Email Service) is a service that exposes SMTP endpoints for your application to directly integrate with.

### SES Tips

-	🔹**Bounce Handling:** Make sure you handle this early enough. Your ability to send emails can be removed if SES sees [too many bounces](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/best-practices-bounces-complaints.html).
-	🔹**Credentials:** Many developers get confused between [SES credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-credentials.html) and AWS API keys. Make sure to enter [SMTP credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/smtp-credentials.html) while using the SMTP APIs.

### SES Gotchas and Limitations

-	🔸**Internet Access:** SES SMTP endpoints are on the Internet and will not be accessible from a location without Internet access (e.g. a private subnet without NAT gateway route in the routing table). In such a case, set up an SMTP relay instance in a subnet with Internet access and configure your application to send emails to this SMTP relay instance rather than SES. The relay should have a [forwarding rule to send all emails to SES](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-smtp-existing-server.html)). ❗If you are using a proxy instead of a NAT, confirm that your proxy service supports SMTP.
