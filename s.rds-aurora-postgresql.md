# RDS Aurora PostgreSQL

### RDS Aurora PostgreSQL Basics

- Amazonâ€™s proprietary fork of PostgreSQL, intended to scale up for high concurrency workloads while maintaining ease of use. Currently based on PostgreSQL 9.6.
- Higher throughput (up to 3x with similar hardware).
- Automatic storage scale in 10GB increments up to 64TB.
- Low latency read replicas that share the storage layer with the master which significantly reduces replica lag.
- Point in time recovery.
- Fast database snapshots.

### RDS Aurora PostgreSQL Tips
- Aurora Postgres by default is supposed to utilize high connection rates and for this reason connection pooling must be configured accordingly.
- Because Aurora is based on PostgreSQL 9.6, it lacks features like declarative partitioning or logical replication.

### RDS Aurora PostgreSQL Gotchas and Limitations
- Aurora PostgreSQL falls behind normal RDS when it comes to available versions, so if you need features from the latest PostgreSQL version you might be better off with plain RDS.
- Patching and bug fixing is separate from open source PostgreSQL.
