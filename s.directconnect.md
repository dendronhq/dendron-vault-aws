### DirectConnect Basics

-	ðŸ“’ [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/) âˆ™ [User guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/) âˆ™ [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/faqs/) âˆ™ [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/pricing/)
-	**Direct Connect** is a private, dedicated connection from your network(s) to AWS.

### DirectConnect Tips

-	If your data center has [a partnering relationship](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/partners/) with AWS, setup is streamlined.
-	Use for more consistent predictable network performance guarantees (**1 Gbps** or **10 Gbps** per link).
-	Use to peer your colocation, corporate, or physical datacenter network with your VPC(s).
	-	Example: Extend corporate LDAP and/or Kerberos to EC2 instances running in a VPC.
	-	Example: Make services that are hosted outside of AWS for financial, regulatory, or legacy reasons callable from within a VPC.
