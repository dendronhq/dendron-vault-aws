# Route 53

### Route 53 Basics

-	üìí [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) ‚àô [Developer guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/) ‚àô [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/faqs/) ‚àô [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/)
-	**Route 53** is AWS‚Äô DNS service.

### Route 53 Alternatives and Lock-In

-	Historically, AWS was slow to penetrate the DNS market (as it is often driven by perceived reliability and long-term vendor relationships) but Route 53 has matured and [is becoming the standard option](https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/dns/) for many companies. Route 53 is cheap by historic DNS standards, as it has a fairly large global network with geographic DNS and other formerly ‚Äúpremium‚Äù features. It‚Äôs convenient if you are already using AWS.
-	‚õìGenerally you don‚Äôt get locked into a DNS provider for simple use cases, but increasingly become tied in once you use specific features like geographic routing or Route 53‚Äôs alias records.
-	üö™Many alternative DNS providers exist, ranging from long-standing premium brands like [UltraDNS](https://www.neustar.biz/services/dns-services) and [Dyn](http://dyn.com/managed-dns/) to less well known, more modestly priced brands like [DNSMadeEasy](http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/). Most DNS experts will tell you that the market is opaque enough that reliability and performance don‚Äôt really correlate well with price.
-	‚è±Route 53 is usually somewhere in the middle of the pack on performance tests, e.g. the [SolveDNS reports](http://www.solvedns.com/dns-comparison/).

### Route 53 Tips

-	üîπKnow about Route 53‚Äôs ‚Äúalias‚Äù records:
	-	Route 53 supports all the standard DNS record types, but note that [**alias resource record sets**](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html) are not standard part of DNS, but a specific Route 53 feature. (It‚Äôs available from other DNS providers too, but each provider has a different name for it.)
	-	Aliases are like an internal name (a bit like a CNAME) that is resolved internally on the server side. For example, traditionally you could have a CNAME to the DNS name of a CLB or ALB, but it‚Äôs often better to make an alias to the same load balancer. The effect is the same, but in the latter case, externally, all a client sees is the target the record points to.
	-	It‚Äôs often wise to use alias record as an alternative to CNAMEs, since they can be updated instantly with an API call, without worrying about DNS propagation.
	-	You can use them for CLBs/ALBs or any other resource where AWS supports it.
	-	Somewhat confusingly, you can have CNAME and A aliases, depending on the type of the target.
	-	Because aliases are extensions to regular DNS records, if exported, the output [zone file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_file) will have additional non-standard ‚ÄúALIAS‚Äù lines in it.
-	[**Latency-based routing**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-latency) allows users around the globe to be automatically directed to the nearest AWS region where you are running, so that latency is reduced.
-	Understand that domain registration and DNS management (hosted zones) are two separate Route 53 services. When you buy/transfer a domain, Route 53 automatically assigns four name servers to it (e.g. ns-2.awsdns-00.com). Route 53 also offers to automatically create a hosted zone for DNS management, but you are not required do your DNS management in the same account or even in Route 53; you just need to create an NS record pointing to the servers assigned to your domain in Route 53.
  - One use case would be to put your domain registration (very mission critical) in a [bastion account](https://cloudonaut.io/your-single-aws-account-is-a-serious-risk/) while managing the hosted zones within another account which is accessible by your applications.

### Route 53 Gotchas and Limitations
-   üî∏Private Hosted Zone will only respond to DNS queries that originate from within a VPC. As a result Route53 will not respond to request made via a VPN or Direct connect. To get around this you will need to implement [Hybrid Cloud DNS Solutions](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/hybrid-cloud-dns-options-for-vpc.pdf) or use the Simple AD provided IP addresses to query the hosted zone.
