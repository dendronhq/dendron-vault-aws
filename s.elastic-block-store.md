# Elastic Block Store

### EBS Basics

-	üìí [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) ‚àô [User guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html) ‚àô [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/faqs/) ‚àô [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/)
-	**EBS** (Elastic Block Store) provides block level storage. That is, it offers storage volumes that can be attached as filesystems, like traditional network drives.
-	EBS volumes can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time. In contrast, EFS can be shared but has a much higher price point ([a comparison](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29575877/aws-efs-vs-ebs-vs-s3-differences-when-to-use)).

### EBS Tips

-	‚è±**RAID:** Use [RAID drives](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/raid-config.html) for [increased performance](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSPerformance.html).
-	‚è±A worthy read is AWS‚Äô [post on EBS IO characteristics](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-io-characteristics.html) as well as their [performance tips](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSPerformance.html#d0e86148).
-	‚è±One can [provision IOPS](http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/details/) (that is, pay for a specific level of I/O operations per second) to ensure a particular level of performance for a disk.
-	‚è±A single gp2 EBS volume allows 16k IOPS max To get the maximum performance out of a gp2 EBS volume, it has to be of a maximum size and attached to an EBS-optimized EC2 instance.
- 	üí∏Standard and gp2 EBS volumes improve IOPS with size. It may make sense for you to simply enlarge a volume instead of paying for better performance explicitly. This can in many cases reduce costs by 2/3.
-	A standard block size for an EBS volume is 16kb.

### EBS Gotchas and Limitations

-	‚ùóEBS durability is reasonably good for a regular hardware drive (annual failure rate of [between 0.1% - 0.2%](http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/details/#availabilityanddurability)). On the other hand, that is very poor if you don‚Äôt have backups! By contrast, S3 durability is extremely high. *If you care about your data, back it up to S3 with snapshots.*
-	üî∏EBS has an [**SLA**](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/sla/) with **99.99%** uptime. See notes on high availability below.
-	‚ùóEBS volumes have a [**volume type**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html) indicating the physical storage type. The types called ‚Äústandard‚Äù (**st1** or **sc1**) are actually old spinning-platter disks, which deliver only hundreds of IOPS ‚Äî not what you want unless you‚Äôre really trying to cut costs. Modern SSD-based **gp2** or **io1** are typically the options you want.
-	‚ùóWhen restoring a snapshot to create an EBS volume, blocks are lazily read from S3 the first time they're referenced. To avoid an initial period of high latency, you may wish to use `dd` or `fio` as per the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-restoring-volume.html).
