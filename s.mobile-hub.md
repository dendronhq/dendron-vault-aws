# Mobile Hub

### Mobile Hub Basics

* üìí [Homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/) ‚àô [User guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile-hub/latest/developerguide/) ‚àô [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/faqs/) ‚àô [Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/pricing/)
- **Mobile Hub** orchestrates multiple services to create an AWS backend for mobile and web applications.
- Each _project_ in Mobile Hub has one _backend_ made up of configurable features, plus one or more _applications_.
 - Features include Analytics, Cloud Logic, Conversational Bots, Hosting and Streaming, NoSQL Database, User Data Storage and User Sign-In. Each feature uses one or two services to deliver a chunk of functionality.
 - Services used include [API Gateway](#api-gateway), [CloudFront](#cloudfront), Cognito, [Device Farm](#device-farm), [DynamoDB](#dynamodb), [Lambda](#lambda), Lex, Pinpoint and [S3](#S3).
 - Application SDKs exist for Android (Java), iOS (Swift), Web (JS) and React Native (JS). There is also a CLI for JavaScript applications.

### Mobile Hub Tips
- The Mobile Hub [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home#/) has starter kits and tutorials for various app platforms.
- The CLI allows local development of Lambda code (JS by default) with `awsmobile {pull|push}` commands, to sync from cloud to folder, and back again.
- Mobile Hub itself is free, but each of the services has its own pricing model.

### Mobile Hub Gotchas and Limitations
- üî∏The Cloud API feature allows importing an existing Lambda function instead of defining a new one, but there are some rough edges with the CLI. Check the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/aws/awsmobile-cli/issues).
- ‚ùóMobile Hub uses CloudFormation under the covers, and gets confused when a service is changed outside of the Mobile Hub console.
